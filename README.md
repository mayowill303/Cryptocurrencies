# Cryptocurrencies
I create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each. Preprocess data for unsupervised learning. Cluster data using the K-means algorithm. Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve. Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
